- [CI/CD failures 2026-07](ci-cd-failures-2026-07.md) — why every workflow was failing: local_auth API drift, release.yml stale Flutter 3.27, missing setup-flutter composite action, real formatters test mismatch (merge itself was fine)
- [microflow release command quirks](release-command-quirks.md) — what `microflow release` does step by step and where it bites (`git add .`, silent tag overwrite, live DB push, interactive prompt)
- [My nickname](my-nickname.md) — Sayan calls me "buddy"; conversational nickname, not a functional rename
- [Relationship & tone](relationship-tone.md) — bros, not agent/user: casual, never sugarcoat, always give the real/better solution

- **What:** Designed complete marketing suite for MicroFlow Pro targeting individual money-lenders in West Bengal. Includes 5-Act Google Veo 3.1 video ad spec (narrator "Siddharth Da", Kolkata dialect, exact Flutter UI workflow), WhatsApp lead copy (`+91 9733657929`), Amazon-style logo prompts, and fully customized Facebook Cover Photo prompts with all text, tagline, and WhatsApp CTA rendered directly in AI image generation.
- **Files created/modified:** `videos/microflow-product/BENGALI_SCRIPT.md` (updated master spec), `memory/target-audience-money-lender.md` (new dedicated audience memory file).
- **Next:** Sayan to copy-paste prompts into Google Imagen 3 / Midjourney for instant FB Cover & Logo, and render Veo 3.1 video clips.

## 2026-07-26 17:40 — Restarted Bengali Facebook organic strategy brainstorming
- **Summary:** Sayan rejected the first generic Bengali calendar/scripts attempt and asked to restart with deeper thinking. Started superpowers brainstorming, explored product positioning docs, identified the safer/stronger framing as a local lender private digital khata rather than NBFC/MFI software, and asked the first audience-choice question.
- **Files created/modified:** `CLAUDE.md` (lesson added: omit `pages` param for non-PDF Read calls); graphify update completed successfully.
- **Next steps:** Wait for Sayan to choose the primary Facebook audience: individual money-lenders, savings collectors, small local microfinance office, or mixed digital-khata positioning.

## 2026-07-26 17:45 — Bengali Facebook audience direction chosen
- **Summary:** Sayan leaned toward mixed positioning for now. Recommended treating MicroFlow as a broader Bengali digital khata for lending + savings + collection, while keeping each reel message narrow and concrete. Sayan delegated CTA choice; recommended comment-to-DM using Bengali keyword “খাতা”, then WhatsApp demo.
- **Files created/modified:** `memory/MEMORY.md`
- **Next steps:** Present 2-3 Bengali content strategy approaches and get approval before drafting calendar/scripts.

## 2026-07-26 17:50 — Recommended Bengali Facebook approach approved
- **Summary:** Sayan approved the recommended approach: problem-first “digital khata” positioning with a trust/security layer, using MicroFlow Pro as the Bengali local digital khata for lending, savings, and collection.
- **Files created/modified:** `memory/MEMORY.md`
- **Next steps:** Present the strategy design section-by-section, then write the spec/calendar/scripts only after approval.

## 2026-07-26 17:55 — Bengali content strategy decision delegated
- **Summary:** Sayan delegated the detailed content decisions with “jo accha lage wo kr, kaam hona chahiye acche se.” Proceeding with a decisive strategy: comment-to-DM CTA, problem-first digital khata positioning, and concise Bengali scripts under 25 seconds.
- **Files created/modified:** `memory/MEMORY.md`
- **Next steps:** Present the final compact design for approval, then write the spec and assets.

## 2026-07-26 18:05 — Asked about automating Facebook content workflow
- **Summary:** Sayan asked whether the Bengali Facebook strategy is complete and whether it can be automated with Claude Code or n8n. Clarified that the strategy/spec is complete but the actual content assets are pending approval/review, and identified a practical hybrid automation path: Claude Code for content generation and n8n for scheduling/approval/delivery.
- **Files created/modified:** `memory/MEMORY.md`
- **Next steps:** If Sayan approves, create actual 30-day calendar/scripts; then optionally design an n8n workflow for draft generation, review, and Facebook scheduling.

## 2026-07-26 18:15 — Day 1 manual content start + Meta API issue
- **Summary:** Sayan decided to start manually today and fix automation tomorrow. Has an issue creating the Meta Graph API key. Wrote the first Bengali reel script for today's manual post at `marketing/bengali-facebook/day-01-reel-script.md`. Asked for details on the Meta error to help troubleshoot.
- **Files created/modified:** `marketing/bengali-facebook/day-01-reel-script.md`, `memory/MEMORY.md`
- **Next steps:** Help with Meta Graph API issue → write Day 2 content → plan tomorrow's n8n automation setup.
